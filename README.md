# Making-VM-Vulnerable

## Intro

Now I will make the Windows virtual machine insecure.

In the Windows virutal machine:
- First I will disable the Windows Firewall.
- I typed in wf.msc in the search bar.
- Then I clicked the Windows Dfender Firewall properties.

- In that application, I will turn off the Domain, Private, and Public profile and then click "Apply" and then "OK"

- They will create the vulnerabilites in the Windows Virutal Machine.
- After installing, I will restart the virutal machine.

## Step 3 is done.
The Windows virtual machine now has outdated software.
